**Project title:** Social Inequality Across Los Angeles County

**Topic:** This project will examine inequalities in regions of Los Angeles based on crime rates, access to food, and access to quality education.

**Motivation:**
With the abundance of data available in today’s age, data science is a tool that can be yielded to
make significant contributions to society. One of today’s most pressing issues, both domestically
and abroad, is social inequity. Specifically, income inequality and public safety threaten the
quality of life of many individuals. We can see this right here in Los Angeles County, with issues
such as housing affordability, homelessness, food insecurity, crime rates, education access and
others permeating the county. In this project, we aim to address some of these issues in order to
provide users with awareness about specific inequalities and issues, and offer information and
solutions to these issues. The purpose of this project is to build an app that compares different
inequalities in different areas of the county in order to determine which areas need most
improvement, funding, resources and public safety. With income inequality continuing to grow in
this area of the state, it is important to examine who is most impacted in order to know what
types of changes need to be made. This app will help people by providing necessary
information about criminality, food availability, and education quality in LA county. By
understanding existing inequality in LA, we can better help our city and neighborhoods
especially at this special time. The app will also provide information on resources and initiatives
currently available to address these issues. Users will be able to search by neighborhood/region
to see which areas are most negatively impacted, and also filter by categories of “crime”,
“education” and “food”.
